## Obtaining an OpenAI API Key

To use this bot, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. Follow these steps to get your key:

1. Visit [OpenAI's API platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Navigate to the [API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and generate a new key.

## Creating a Telegram Bot Token

To interact with Telegram's Bot API, you need a bot token. Here's how to create one:

1. Open Telegram and search for the "BotFather" user.
2. Start a chat and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
3. Follow the instructions to set a name and username for your bot.
4. BotFather will provide a token; keep this token secure as it allows control over your bot.

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the bot's directory
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
